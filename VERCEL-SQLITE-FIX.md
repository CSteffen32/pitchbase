# Vercel SQLite Build Fix - Summary

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

The build was failing because `sitemap.ts` and `rss.xml` were trying to access the SQLite database **during the build process**. Vercel's build environment doesn't allow SQLite file access at build time.

## üîß Fix Applied

1. **Made routes dynamic** - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to both files
   - This prevents Next.js from trying to query the database during build
   - Routes now generate on-demand at runtime instead

2. **Added error handling** - Wrapped database queries in try/catch
   - If database is unavailable, routes return empty/minimal content instead of crashing
   - Build succeeds even if database can't be accessed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: SQLite Limitations on Vercel

**This fix allows the build to succeed, but SQLite still has limitations:**

1. **Ephemeral Database**: SQLite files reset between serverless function invocations
2. **No Persistence**: Data won't persist across deployments
3. **Read-only during build**: Database can't be accessed during static generation

### For Production, You Should:

**Switch to PostgreSQL (Recommended):**
- **Supabase** (500MB free) - Easiest setup
- **Neon** (512MB free) - Serverless PostgreSQL
- **Railway** (Free tier available)

**Steps to migrate:**
1. Sign up for Supabase/Neon
2. Get PostgreSQL connection string
3. Update `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
4. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource to `postgresql`
5. Run `npx prisma db push` to create tables
6. Redeploy on Vercel

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- ‚úÖ Build succeeds locally
- ‚úÖ Build will succeed on Vercel
- ‚úÖ Routes work dynamically at runtime
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SQLite data may be ephemeral (depends on Vercel's filesystem)

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor Vercel deployment** - Should succeed now

3. **Test the deployed app:**
   - If database works ‚Üí Great! You're good for now
   - If database errors occur ‚Üí Time to migrate to PostgreSQL

4. **For production:** Plan to migrate to PostgreSQL when ready
